Thirty-three chemotherapy-naive&#13;&#10;patients with NSCLC were enrolled in the study and 30 of them were evaluable. The&#13;&#10;mean age of the patients was 61 years. Twenty (66.7%) out of 30 patients were&#13;&#10;&gt;or=60 years, and 5 (16.7%) patients were &gt;or=70 years. The ECOG performance&#13;&#10;status was 0 to 1 in 30 patients and 2 in 3 patients. Twenty-six patients (78.8%)&#13;&#10;had stage IIIB disease and 7 (21.2%) had stage IV; histology was mainly squamous &#13;&#10;cell carcinoma (72.7%). The treatment consisted of cisplatin 40 mg/m2/week and&#13;&#10;epirubicin 40 mg/m2/week both intravenously on day 1, rIL-2 1.8 MIU/day&#13;&#10;subcutaneously, MPA 1 g/day orally, alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg/day orally and&#13;&#10;N-acetyl cysteine 1.8 g/day orally. The treatment was administered for 6 weeks.&#13;&#10;Patients with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease&#13;&#10;(SD) continued the treatment, according to response re-evaluation, until 15&#13;&#10;weeks. The present study reports the results of 6, 9, 12 and 15-week treatment.&#13;&#10;After 6 weeks, 30 patients were assessable for response: no CR was observed, a PR&#13;&#10;was achieved in 15 patients (50%; ORR 50%). After 15 weeks, 1 CR and 8 PR were&#13;&#10;observed (ORR 30.0%). The median follow-up period was 13 months. The median&#13;&#10;duration of response was 9 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 15&#13;&#10;months. The one-year survival rate was 55.8%. The median progression-free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS) was 10 months. The toxicity was, as expected, mainly hematologic: &#13;&#10;neutropenia was the most significant symptom. The non-hematologic toxicity was&#13;&#10;quite low. Therefore, the treatment's toxicity was quite acceptable. There was no&#13;&#10;toxic death. The 30.0% ORR, the 15 month OS and the 10 month PFS obtained in this&#13;&#10;study are comparable with those observed with cisplatin plus epirubicin (ORR&#13;&#10;39-54%) in phase II studies and in a previous phase III study (ORR 33%, OS 10.5&#13;&#10;months). Moreover, the toxicity was acceptable and it was mainly hematologic.&#13;&#10;Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly decreased after&#13;&#10;treatment."/>
