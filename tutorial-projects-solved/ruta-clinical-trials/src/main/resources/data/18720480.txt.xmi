Ten patients had a&#13;&#10;history of treated brain metastases. Thirty-one patients who received at least 2 &#13;&#10;cycles of IL-2 were evaluable for response. Grade 3 toxicities included&#13;&#10;hyperbilirubinemia (9 patients), hematologic toxicities (leukopenia in 5&#13;&#10;patients, thrombocytopenia in 3 patients), diarrhea (2 patients), and oliguria (1&#13;&#10;patient). One patient had grade 4 nausea. The overall response rate (ORR) was 16%&#13;&#10;and included 3 complete responses that lasted 10.8 months, &gt; or =32 months, and &gt;&#13;&#10;or =36 months and 2 partial responses that lasted 13 months and 14 months.&#13;&#10;Responses were observed in patients with M1a disease and in patients with M1c&#13;&#10;disease. Sixteen patients had stable disease (15 patients progressed). The median&#13;&#10;progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI],&#13;&#10;3.7-7.5 months). The probability of PFS at 6 months was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.33-0.67).&#13;&#10;Among 38 enrolled patients, 16 patients remained alive at a median follow-up of&#13;&#10;6.7 months (range, 1.9-36.1 months). The median overall survival (OS) was 12.1&#13;&#10;months (95% CI, 9.1-16.4 months), and the probability of 12-month OS was 0.54&#13;&#10;(95% CI, 0.34-0.70 months).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that it is safe to administer HD IL-2 &#13;&#10;sequentially with temozolomide and that this combination has lower toxicity than &#13;&#10;previously used concurrent biochemotherapy regimens. However, The ORR and the&#13;&#10;durability of responses with this combination did not exceed those of&#13;&#10;single-agent HD IL-2."/>
